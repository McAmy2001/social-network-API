## Installation 
Clone the repository from GitHub onto your machine in a local folder. This program will require Node.js and MongoDB. Install node.js: [Installation Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs). Install MongoDB: [Installation Information](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/). From the root of the project folder do an npm (Node Package Manager) install to get the package dependencies (type `npm install` on the command line). Dependencies used are: express.js, mongoose, and date-and-time. 
## Usage 
This is the back end only so you'll need to use Insomnia, Postman, or similar app. You can add, view, update, and delete users and thoughts. You can also add and delete friends for users and reactions to thoughts.
